# üìù Tiny AI Text Summarizer

## Project Overview
Tiny AI Text Summarizer is an AI-powered web application that converts long articles, blogs, or any text into **concise 2-3 sentence summaries**.  
It uses Hugging Face's `facebook/bart-large-cnn` model and Streamlit to demonstrate a practical AI integration for text summarization.
